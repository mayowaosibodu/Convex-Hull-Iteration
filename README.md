# Convex-Hull-Iteration

This repository contains code which accompanies the paper: 

The paper describes "Convex Hull Iteration" - a technique to estimate model performance on extreme counterfactuals.

convex_hull_iteration.py contains Python code demonstrating the technique and visualizing results.

The code is written in Python3, and dependencies can be found in requirements.txt, and can be installed with:
