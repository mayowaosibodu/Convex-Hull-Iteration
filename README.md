# Convex-Hull-Iteration

This repository contains code which accompanies the paper: [Assessing Model Behaviour on Extreme Counterfactuals] (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360912277_Assessing_Model_Behaviour_on_Extreme_Counterfactuals)

The paper describes "Convex Hull Iteration" - a technique to estimate model performance on extreme counterfactuals.

```convex_hull_iteration.py``` contains Python code demonstrating the technique and visualizing results.

The code is written in Python 3.

Dependencies are in requirements.txt, and can be installed with:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
